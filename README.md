Programming Sandbox - Linux Application Development Stack


Purpose of this Project:

Hands on with elements within the Linux Application Development stack as well as, to resynch my knowledge and understanding of the Linux Kernel (4.x)


Why is this a sandbox project and not DLR - its targetted at specific technologies within the standardized elements of the stack and not the more general market space. (i.e. no Ubuntu vs RHEL vs CentOS, etc) - Just elements to the programming stack that are common across distros. No OpenStack, etc. (as, afaik, that is a vendor specific realization)

Target Elements:
   - CLI/Terminal
      - Basic/Primary Commands
      - Advanced Commands, Command Suites (i.e. Sed/Awk)
      - Various Shells
      - Editors
      - Shell Scripting
   - System level constructs
      - Users, Groups, etc
      - init.d
      - SystemCtl/SystemD
      - Logging
         - Syslog
         - Journalled Logging
      - XFS File system
   - Core Programming Concepts, Constructs
      - Signals/Message Passing/Inter-Process Communication
      - Sockets
      - Threading
         - ReEntrant, Non-Reentrant Functions
   - Application Programming APIs
      - Posix Threads (pthreads)
   - The Kernal
      - Major features by Kernal version
   - Device Driver Development
   - Resources
      - The Great Linux Programming Books,
